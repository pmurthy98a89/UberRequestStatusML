## Abstract
Our team chose the Uber Requests dataset for our final project, consisting of pickup points, trip date, pickup time, and drop-off time. We will use these features to discover correlations between the time of day, location, and request completion. Our model will attempt to predict the status of an Uber trip if it is completed or not. Our project can help Uberâ€™s research department to pinpoint times with high uncompleted requests. Furthermore, it can help users determine the likelihood of a canceled or incomplete trip.   

As far as actual data analysis goes, we will begin by manipulating and cleaning the data. This includes removing unnecessary columns, dealing with missing data entries, adding clarifying columns to better model the time and dates, and acquiring critical, descriptive statistics to help us read the data easier. Things like outliers and distributions will not need to be applied to this dataset with categorical type data. We will be using the SVM and Random Forest algorithms to help determine the status of the uber request based on specific predictors.
