## Abstract
For our final project, we are choosing to use Uber Requests dataset that consists of the pickup points, trip date, pickup time, and drop off time. We will use these features to discover any correlations between time of day, location, and request completion. Our model will attempt to predict the status of an Uber trip if it is completed or not. Our project can help Uberâ€™s research department to pinpoint times with high uncompleted requests. Furthermore, it can help users find out the likelihood of a trip to be cancelled or uncompleted.   

As far as actual data analysis goes, we will begin by properly manipulating and cleaning the data. This includes removing unnecessary columns, dealing with missing data entries, adding clarifying columns to better model the time and dates, and acquiring important descriptive statistics to help us read the data easier. We will be using the SVM and Random Forest algorithms to help determine the status of the uber request based on certain predictors.
